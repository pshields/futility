Futility
========

**Futility** is RoboCup 2D Simulation League agent software written by Team F(utility) for the Fall 2011 Software Engineering I semester project at the University of Kansas.

To see it in action (assuming rcssserver and rcssmonitor are installed):

1. Set up an Eclipse Java project in the project root.
2. Add the JUnit 4 library in the Eclipse project preferences.
3. Run `rcssserver` and `rcssmonitor`.
4. Run `./manage.sh compete` from the project root!
    1. For a less computationally-intensive example, run `./manage.sh scrimmage`.
    2. To spin up just one team (e.g. for a competition), run `./manage.sh start`.
