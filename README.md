Futility
========

To see it in action (assuming rcssserver and rcssmonitor are installed):

1. Set up an Eclipse Java project in the project root.
2. Add the JUnit 4 library in the Eclipse project preferences.
2. Run `rcssserver` and `rcssmonitor`.
3. Add an Eclipse Java run configuration calling futility.Main (add a command-line argument `-c` to see two teams compete.)
4. Run the code from eclipse.
